# Skin Lesion Analyzer

### What is this all about?
The aim of this project is to detect **skin lesions** using a deep learning model. This project is a part of the ongoing **[#PoweredByTF 2.0 Challenge! ](https://tensorflow.devpost.com/)**. As the challenge is based on TF2.0, our aim is to build something in order to showcase:
* The ease of using TF2.0
* The power and simplicity of **Keras**
* The exceptional **tflite** framweork

### Introduction
Any type of cancer is somehow deeply dangerous if not deadly. To see how bad the sitaution is, let us look at some of the stats given by the [skin cncer organisation](https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/):
* One in five Americans will develop skin cancer by the age of 70
* Actinic keratosis is the most common precancer; it affects more than 58 million Americans
* The annual cost of treating skin cancers in the U.S. is estimated at $8.1 billion: about $4.8 billion for nonmelanoma skin cancers and $3.3 billion for melanoma.
* Skin cancer represents approximately 2 to 4 percent of all cancers in Asians
* Skin cancer represents 4 to 5 percent of all cancers in Hispanics
* Skin cancer represents 1 to 2 percent of all cancers in blacks
